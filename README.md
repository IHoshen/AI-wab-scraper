This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered web scraper using Python. The application allows users to input a URL, from which it scrapes the site's DOM content. 
Using AI, users can pass prompts to dynamically extract specific information from the website. The front end was built with Streamlit, with the main application logic located in the main.py file. 
The scrape.py file leverages Selenium to scrape the targeted website, while the parse.py file uses the Ollama model and LangChain to extract desired content directly from the website's body.
This implementation combines these powerful tools—Selenium, BeautifulSoup, LangChain, 
and Ollama—providing a comprehensive demo and development walkthrough to showcase the responsive and intelligent web scraping solution.
